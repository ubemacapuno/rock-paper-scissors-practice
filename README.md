Rock Paper Scissors practice, but with Gen 1 starter Pokemon <br />
This is a project I created using Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. <br />
It is a rock, paper, scissors application, but instead with the Gen 1 starter Pokémon! <br />
A lot of Pokémon typing is based around triangles (fire-grass-water, fighting-flying-rock, etc); same concept as rock, paper, scissors, so the logic is the same!
